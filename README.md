# UAV-Coverage
Simulations for planar area coverage by a swarm of UAVs equipped with downwards facing cameras.

## Usage
Included are simulations taking into account different sensing patterns, coverage quality functions and region importance functions, each one being a different `.m` file. The initial network configuration and all simulation parameters are set inside these files which contain comments on their exact usage. The following simulations are included:
* `UAV_coverage_uniform_quality.m` simulates a network with circular sensing patterns and uniform coverage quality on a region whose points have equal importance.
* `UAV_coverage_decreasing_quality.m` simulates a network with with circular sensing patterns and decreasing coverage quality (paraboloid) on a region whose points have equal importance.
* `UAV_coverage_decreasing_quality.m` simulates a network with circular sensing patterns and uniform coverage quality on a region whose points are assigned importance weights by a function phi.
* `UAV_coverage_anisotropic.m` simulates a network with with elliptical sensing patterns and uniform coverage quality on a region whose points have equal importance.

Included are also some `.m` files used for plotting the results of the aforementioned simulations, namely `FIGURE_simulation_results.m`, `FIGURE_simulation_comparison.m` and `FIGURE_simulation_results_anisotropic.m`.

Each simulation is structured as follows:
```c
Initialize region
Initialize network
Initialize simulation
while simulation is running {
    for each agent {
        Create sensed region
        Calculate coverage quality
    }
    for each agent {
        Calculate its assigned sensed region
    }
    Calculate the value of the optimization objective H
    Plot the network state
    for each agent {
        Calculate the control inputs
        Simulate movement with an ODE solver
    }
}
Save results to timestamped .mat file
```
